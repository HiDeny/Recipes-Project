        <!-- Instructions -->
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cook brown rice by package instructions.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Start by caramelizing the onions. Place 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of avocado oil and the sliced yellow onion in a large heavy-bottomed skillet (like a large cast iron pan or Dutch oven) and turn it to medium-low heat. Stir constantly and sauté until the onions begin to turn translucent, then turn the heat down to low. Add 2 tablespoons of water and cover, removing the lid every few minutes and stirring to prevent burning. Cook the onions for at least 25 minutes, until they’ve taken on some color and have reduced by about half.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add another 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of avocado oil to the onions along with the sliced mushrooms. Spread the mushrooms out so they are in as thin a layer as possible and turn the heat up to medium-low. Sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the mushrooms are fragrant and soft. Turn the heat off and set aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    In the meantime, if using noodles that require boiling, bring a large pot of water to a boil (otherwise skip this step). Once boiling, add a healthy pinch of salt and your lasagna noodles (or other pasta shape). Cook according to package instructions to achieve an al dente texture — tender with a little bite. Then drain and set aside. Optional: Drizzle pasta with a little oil to prevent sticking.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Place the cashews in a food processor and pulse until cashews are a small, even crumb texture — about 10 pulses. Place the cashew crumbs in a bowl and set aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Next, make your "cheese." Add macadamia nuts (or sub soaked cashews) to a food processor or a high-speed blender along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and sea salt and mix/blend into a loose paste.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add the cooled rice to the now-empty food processor and pulse until slightly crumbled, about 5 pulses. Add the cooked mushrooms and onions and pulse until well combined with no obvious or large pieces of mushrooms remaining — about another 5 pulses.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add the oat flour (starting with the lesser amount), salt and pepper, miso paste, coconut aminos, and smoked paprika, and pulse a few times to combine. Add the cashew crumble and pulse once or twice to distribute the cashews without over mixing. The mixture should be thick and sticky, but easy to form into patties. If too wet, add more oat flour and stir by hand. Taste and adjust, as needed, adding more salt to taste.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Using a 1/2-cup measuring cup, scoop your burger mixture and form into 4 even patties. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) avocado oil in your heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, and place the patties in the oil. Cover and let cook for about 3 minutes, uncover and flip, then cover and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Continue cooking if the patties aren’t as crispy as you’d like.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Enjoy! Serve on buns with ketchup, vegan mayo, tomatoes, lettuce, and your other favorite burger toppings! Vegan burger patties can be saved before or after cooking, and will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or the freezer for up to 1 month. Reheat cooked burgers on the stove top over medium heat until warmed through and fragrant.
